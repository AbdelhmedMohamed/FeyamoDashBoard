🧩 Feyamo Dashboard (ASP.NET MVC) – an admin panel for managing hotels, tourist places, images, and prices.

⚙️ Feyamo API (ASP.NET Web API) – provides structured and secure endpoints to serve data to the frontend.

💻 Feyamo Angular App (coming soon) – a user-facing single-page application for browsing and booking hotels and attractions.
